## Hi there! 👋
### About Me 💬 
Welcome! I'm Kristen, a dedicated self-taught developer based in Southern California. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology in 2016, but my true calling in technology emerged shortly after. This led me to earn a degree in Information Technology in 2020 and a Master's in Information Technology in 2024. With a background as an avid gamer, I naturally transitioned into the programming world, continuously enhancing my skills through self-study and practical projects.

- 🏢 I work for a Medical School as an Application and Database Developer.
