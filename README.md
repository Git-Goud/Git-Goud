## Hi there! 👋
### About Me 💬 
Hi I’m Kristen, a self-taught developer from Southern California. Even though I just found my passion for coding I am obsessed with it! I started off getting my Bachelors of Science degree in Kinesiology, when I realized Technology is what I really enjoy learning about. So I got another degree in Information Technology, but what I didn't know is... I actually really love to program! Yikes, two degrees and now I find my calling! I didn't hesitate to dive right into the world of coding. Already being a huge nerd and gamer, I was familiar with the possibilities of what this new skill would take me. From there on I have been self-studying computer science and working on projects to show my skill and dedication to this wonderful world of programming.

- 🤔 I’m looking for my first Junior Developer position.
