## Hi there! 👋
### About Me 💬 
Welcome! I'm Kristen, a dedicated self-taught developer based in Southern California. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology in 2016, but my true calling in technology emerged shortly after. This led me to earn a degree in Information Technology in 2020. My discovery of Python marked a turning point, igniting a deep passion for coding. With a background as an avid gamer, I seamlessly transitioned into the programming world, continuously enhancing my skills through self-study and practical projects. Currently, I'm advancing my expertise by pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology, with a keen interest in Machine Learning and AI.
