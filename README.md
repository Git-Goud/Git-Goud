## Hi there! üëã
### About Me üí¨ 
Hi I‚Äôm Kristen, a self-taught developer from Southern California. Even though I just found my passion for coding I am obsessed with it! In 2016 I received my Bachelors of Science degree in Kinesiology. I soon realized Technology is what I really enjoy learning about. In 2020, received another degree in Information Technology, but what I didn't know is... I actually really love programming! Yikes, two degrees and now I find my calling! I didn't hesitate to dive right into the world of coding. Already being a huge nerd and gamer, I was familiar with the possibilities of what this new skill would take me. From there on I have been self-studying computer science and working on projects to show my skill and dedication to this wonderful world of programming. Specifically looking into getting into the field of Machine Learning and AI.

- üè¢ I work for a Medical School as an Application and Database Developer.
