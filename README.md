## Hi there! 👋
### About Me 💬 
Hi I’m Kristen, a self-taught developer from Southern California. Even though I just found my passion for coding I am obsessed with it! In 2016 I received my Bachelors of Science degree in Kinesiology. I soon realized Technology is what I really enjoy learning about. In 2020, I received another degree in Information Technology. I soon stumbled upon python and fell in love! I didn't hesitate to dive right into the world of programming. Already being a huge nerd and gamer, I was familiar with the possibilities of where this new skill would take me. From there on I have been self-studying computer science and working on projects to show my skill. Specifically looking into getting into the field of Machine Learning and AI.

- 🏢 I work for a Medical School as an Application and Database Developer.
